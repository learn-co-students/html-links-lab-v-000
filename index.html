    <!-- Challenge 1: Wrap the text below with a link that has an absolute path -->
    <a href="https://www.google.com"> Absolute Path (external link) </a>
    <!--The href attribute in this example, is an full link, also known as an absolute path.-->

    <!-- Challenge 2: Wrap the text below with a link that has a relative path to about.html-->
    <a href="./index.html"> Relative Path (internal link) </a>
    <!--Alternatively, we can also use a relative path, 
      which is used when we want to link to a separate file on the same website:-->

    <!-- Challenge 3: Wrap the img tag below with a link that uses the target attribute -->
    <a href="https://learn.co/" target="_blank"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard-learn/lion.jpg" alt="a lion"></a>
    <!-- The target attribute can be added along side href and has a specific use: 
      setting this attribute to be target='_blank' will cause the browser to open a new tab when the link is clicked, 
      instead of changing the current page you are on:-->
